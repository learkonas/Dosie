Dosie was a separate project to store tweets in a Notion DB. The code pulled tweets and threads, formatted them, and stored them in Notion. I ended the project, before implementing the webhooks to run this properly, when Twitter put up steep costs around API usage. Today, this repo is used for my easter.leonasskau.com Easter Treasure Hunt 2023 game, harking back to a time when I was confused by .env files and avoided having to set one up again by just using the same env file in the same folder.
